## How to contribute to this repository

# Committing
  Every contributor MUST create its own branch on which he creates commits. You can create as many branches as you want, but please, delete branches that are not needed anymore to keep this repository clean.
  You can do make all commits on a single branch, but it would be better if you create a single branch for every bigger update.
  Every commit should include only one changed file. If you want to change more files, you should do that in more than one commit.
  Write short, but descriptive commit messages that explain everything that was changed. If you added a new feature and fixed a typo while doing it, don't forget to mention the fix too.

# Pull requests
  Don't post pull requests after every minor commit. Post it only once you completed a feature or fixed a bug. NEVER create pull requests for branches that contain an unfinished update. If you want to merge a branch with an unfinished update, you can do so after a reasonable amount of time to keep the master branch up-to-date, but you MUST mention in your pull request that the update is incomplete.
  Merged branch won't be deleted by default by the project manager to prevent unwanted deletions, but if you the branch won't be needed after the merge, you should mention in your pull request, so the project manager can delete the branch immediately after merging it. This will help to keep the repository clean.
