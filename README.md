This repository contains my PHP app that can be used for learning for biology recognition tests.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello. Welcome to my little project.
Have you ever had to memorize some animals, plants or minerals for your biology lessons and be able to recognize them on pictures?
This PHP app is right what you need to memorize this kind of things easier.
You just need to create a list of organisms you need to learn, and then you (and anyone else) can upload images from which you will learn.
After that, you can learn in your own pace, or you can let the app create a random test for you from the pictures you uploaded, so you can see how well do learnt that.

I am looking for other developers that would help me with this. Currently, it is all working perfectly, but I am still adding new things and as the project grows, it becomes harder and harder to maintain.
The app is currently only in my native language (Czech), so I am looking for volunteers that would be willing to translate it into languages they know.
Let me know here on GitHub if you want to help me with development, or if you just have an interesting suggestion.

If you want to create your own list of organisms to learn via this app, contact me and I will add the organisms you send me.
